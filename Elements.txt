All elements of whiteboard are inherited from bay.whiteboard.Element.
The basic attributes are:
	id 	(integer)	index of the element in the collection list
	label	(string)	text label for the element
	color	(string)	color of the element
	trace	(boolean)	flag if the element should left trace when moved
	hidden	(boolean)	flag if the element hidden (not visible)
	type	(string)	type (class) of the element

Each specific element has also own properties depending on it type. Types of elements are listed below:
