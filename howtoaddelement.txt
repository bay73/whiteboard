To create nerw element type for whiteboard you need:

1. Create an object inherited from bay.whiteboard.Element:  goog.inherits(new element, bay.whiteboard.Element);
	It is possible also to extend any existing element.
	If new element uses some reference to other elements then it should be added to the dependant lists of them.

2. Define methods for the object:
	2.1. deleteElement, which correctly clear dependant lists of referenced elements

	2.2. toString

	2.3. distance - this method takes a point as parameter and return the distance between thios point and our object.
		The method is needed to correct work of onHover.

	2.4. recalc - this method will be calld at any time when referenced objects are changed

	2.5. draw - this method takes a board as a parameter and draw the current object on board.graphics
		The method should take into account - coordinates on board are different from coordinates on graphics - use board.area.transformation to recalc.

	2.6. toJson - function should return string with json-representation of the object

3. Define class method fromJson which parse json data and restore object

	3.1. register thos fromJson method using bay.whiteboard.Collection.setFromJsonFunc

4. Create user tool to draw new object

	4.1. define toggleOn method which is invoked when user choose the tool
		this method should initialize all auxiliary variables which needed for drawing

	4.2. define toggleOff method which remove auxiliary variables created by toggleOn

	4.3. define onClick method - this will be invoke when user click the board during tool is active
		if the drawing has several steps, then it should switch them, if there is only one step, then it should be finished there and call board.tool.current.toggleOff(board);

	4.4. define onMove method - this will be invoke when user moves mouse board during tool is active

	4.5. register new tool using bay.whiteboard.Whiteboard.addTool
		Parameters:
		label - the name of the tool
		group - the name of group where new tool will be added
		object with toggleOn, toggleOff, onMove and onClick prooperties
		order - the order of the tool inside the group
		comment - the text which will be shown as tooltip
